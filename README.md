Questions and Answers (RQAA)
======
**Can I download a source code of your mod, modify it, compile and play?**
- No, you can't. I mean, physically you can but if you break the rules, I'll break them too.

**Can I download a source code of your mod, compile and play?**
- Look at the answer above.

**Can I contribute to your mod?**
- Yes, indeed you can. You can either contribute by Pull-Requesting your code to my project or
giving me ideas / bug-reports through "Issues" on my project. If you pull-request something
useful in my opinion or give an awesome suggestion / bug-report you'll be added to mod's
contributors and to the credits of my mod. By the way you can check [**credits here**].

**Ha-ha-ha. I'm baad, I'm going to download your source code, recompile it and even MODIFY!!!**
- If you're breaking the rules, I'll break the rules too. I highly recommend you **not to do it**,
because it can cause some bad aftermath.

**I enjoy making textures and models for Minecraft. I would like to make textures/models for your mod because yours are shit**
- Oh man. If you're going to make Oceany blocks, items or whatever look nice than you will be in the list
of **authors** of the mod. Because coding is the easiest part, believe it or not. Personally, I'm really
bad at drawing, texturing, modeling and all that kind of graphical stuff.

**I want to legally have access to alpha versions your mod**
